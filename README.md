# md-preview

This is a simple project that previews markdown in a browser as you type in
your editor. The markdown is rendered using GH markdown.

Exit the `preview.md` file and watch it live update.

This project is also an example project using Nix flakes. See `.envrc`. This is
intended to be used with nix-direnv. When entering the directory, a preview
server is started and all the dependencies are made available.

## Why?

I find that GitHub issues and Slack messages take time to write and I to them in
my editor instead of the native textboxes. I like the preview.
